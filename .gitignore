# Git repository ignore pattern
# B&R Automation Studio 4 projects
# Including considerations for Safety projects (unofficial)
#
# This .gitignore file serves as a starting point for Automation Studio 4 projects even with Safety (unofficial)
# The starting "/" have to be adapted to match the actual structure of the repository

 
# Ignore AR versions as those are not considered part of the project
/AS/System/

# Ignore build results
/Binaries/

# Ignore (all) debugging content
/Diagnosis/**
# But save the watch windows and task trace configurations (if it should stay in the repository) - optional, uncomment if needed
#!/Diagnosis/**/
#!/Diagnosis/**/*.PVM
#!/Diagnosis/**/*.tc

# Ignore standard temp folder
/Temp/

# Ignore upgrades as those are not considered part of the project source code
/Upgrades/

# Ignore user settings file
/*.set
# Include all the Safety related .set files - all the .set files in the Physical folder
!/Physical/**/*.set
# Ignore is open indication
/*.isopen

# Unnoficial strategies when using Safety. Uncomment the appropriate lines depending on whether you are using mapp Safety or Legacy Safety.
# Alternatively, you can also choose to commit the complete safety project, without ignoring any of its parts.
# mapp Safety:
# Ignore CPU folder in mapp Safety - ..\{ASprojectName}\Physical\{ConfigName}\{PLCname}\mappSafety\{SafetyProjectName}\C\PLC\R\CPU
#/Physical/*/*/mappSafety/*/C/PLC/R/CPU/*
# But include the required binary files
#!/Physical/*/*/mappSafety/*/C/PLC/R/CPU/src.st1
#!/Physical/*/*/mappSafety/*/C/PLC/R/CPU/tmp.sto
# And include global variables translation file
#!/Physical/*/*/mappSafety/*/C/PLC/R/CPU/GLOBAL_VARIABLESTranslation_SF.xml
# Legacy safety:
# Ignore CPU folder in Legacy Safety - ..\{ASprojectName}\Physical\{ConfigName}\{PLCname}\{SafetyProjectName}\C\PLC\R\CPU
#/Physical/*/*/*/C/PLC/R/CPU/*
# But include the required binary files
#!/Physical/*/*/*/C/PLC/R/CPU/src.st1
#!/Physical/*/*/*/C/PLC/R/CPU/tmp.sto
# And include global variables translation file
#!/Physical/*/*/*/C/PLC/R/CPU/GLOBAL_VARIABLESTranslation_SF.xml

# Ignore archives, as these shouldn't be in Git (if necessary, comment out these rules and place the archives in LFS)
